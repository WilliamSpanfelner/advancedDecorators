# Advanced Decorators - Higher-Lower game, Simple Positional and Unlimited Positional Arguments  
- 👋 Hi, I’m @WilliamSpanfelner
- 👀 I’m interested in using Python with Swift in iOS environments and why it may or may not be desirable.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more Python with the London App Brewery and Angela Yu's [100 Days of Code: 
The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) on Udemy.  

- 🧑‍💻 There are three projects in this repo.  The Advanced Decorators Python project illustrates how to use case a decorator function with positional arguments.  This ability allows the exploitation of arguments passed into a function within the decorator.  The Logging Decorator takes a function with unlimited positional arguments and performs some magic with them, ultimately spitting out some facts. Finally, the Higher-Lower game (server.py) will test your skill at guessing a randomly generated number. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on application development.
